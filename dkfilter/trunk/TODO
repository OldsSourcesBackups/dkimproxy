Desired features:
 - allow canonicalization method to be specified (e.g. "nofws" or "simple")
 - support multiple sending domains, multiple selectors, multiple private keys
   (the signing process must use the sending domain to determine what
   private key and selector should be used to sign the message)
 - sign/verify a message without having to read it completely into memory
 - sign/verify in the same program

Possible bugs:
 - the Mail::DomainKeys module frequently makes assumptions that it's in
   a Unix environment ... e.g. it uses "\r\n" where it should use "\015\012"
   (see perlport(1)'s discussion of Newlines)
