 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added senderdomain method, to get the host part of the address used
     to sign or verify

2005-04-28: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * dkfilter.out:
   - added "method" command-line argument to specify what canonicalization
     method should be used to sign messages ("simple" or "nofws")
   - "domain" argument can now take multiple domains, separated by commas
   - when signing a message, pick the best matching domain (from the
     "domain" argument) for the address used in the Sender: or From: header

 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added documentation
 * dkfilter.in:

     inbound filter for use in Authentication-Results headers

 * DKMessage.pm:
   - if signature verification fails, put the reason in the syslog and
     in the Authentication-Results header

     domain
