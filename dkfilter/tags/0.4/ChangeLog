 * Mail/DomainKeys/Key/Public.pm:
   - use ALRM signal to catch a long-running DNS query; currently the timeout
     is 10 seconds; if you're verifying in an After-Queue filter, it should
     be safe to set this timeout higher
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Policy.pm:
   - use ALRM signal to catch a long-running DNS query
 * dkfilter.in, dkfilter.out:
   - fixed another glitch in the way errors were reported

2005-04-29: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added senderdomain method, to get the host part of the address used
     to sign or verify

2005-04-28: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * dkfilter.out:
   - added "method" command-line argument to specify what canonicalization
     method should be used to sign messages ("simple" or "nofws")
   - "domain" argument can now take multiple domains, separated by commas
   - when signing a message, pick the best matching domain (from the
     "domain" argument) for the address used in the Sender: or From: header

 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added documentation
 * dkfilter.in:
   - error messages may not have been logged correctly; it should work
     better now
 * init-script.sh:
   - determine FQDN hostname using `hostname -f` and pass it to the
     inbound filter for use in Authentication-Results headers

2005-04-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - if signature verification fails, put the reason in the syslog and
     in the Authentication-Results header
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Signature.pm:
   - allow signatures that use a parent domain of the message's from/sender
     domain
