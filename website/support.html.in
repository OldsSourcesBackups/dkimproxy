<h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p>
Please check the <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page
if you have a problem. It is possible there is already a known solution
to your problem.
</p>
<p>
Here I will try to document unresolved issues with Mail::DKIM or DKIMproxy.
</p>
<!--
<p>
There are currently no known flaws in DKIMproxy.
</p>
-->
<ul>
<li>DNS support -- verification is really slow if the first DNS server listed
in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> is not responding. If you do a lot of DKIM
verification, it's probably a good idea to install a local DNS resolver.</li>
<li>Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA - the test script segfaults if version 0.21 of
Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA is installed. It appears version 0.22 is the minimum
supported version.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you notice any problems,
let me know so I can add them to this list.
</p>

<h2>Interoperability Testing</h2>
<p>
The following email address is configured to auto-respond with DKIM
verification results. It uses the dkimproxy implementation as found on this
web page.
</p>
<p>
<a href="mailto:test@dkimtest.jason.long.name">test@dkimtest.jason.long.name</a>
</p>
<p>
For best results, place the words <tt>dkim</tt> and/or <tt>test</tt> in the
subject of your message. This will reduce the likelihood of your message
getting quarantined by my spam filters.
</p>
<p>
Note 1: the above auto-responder responds to the <em>SMTP envelope sender</em>;
i.e. it ignores contents of From: and Reply-to: headers when making its
reply.
</p>
<p>
Note 2: the above auto-responder deals with the validity of the signature
itself. It does NOT apply any signing policies.
</p>

<p>
The following auto-responders are offered by others, and will test your
signed messages against other implementations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>dkim-test AT mtcc DOT com</li>
<li>dktest AT exhalus DOT net</li>
<li>dktest AT blackops DOT org</li>
<li>sa-test AT sendmail DOT net</li>
<!--
<li>dkim-test AT dkim DOT org (broken as of 2006-12-18... relaying denied?)</li>
-->
</ul>

<!--
<p>
Additional auto-responders are listed on the
<a href="http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net">DomainKeys Implementors Site</a>.
These auto-responders use different implementations of the DomainKeys spec,
so it's a good idea to try them out as well. Unfortunately, I have found
several of them do not seem to properly verify signatures using the
<tt>h=</tt> tag. See <a href="tester-status.html">testers-status</a>.

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>
If you need help with DKIMproxy, or with the Perl module (Mail::DKIM),
feel free to use one of the following tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkimproxy/">Sourceforge Project page for DKIMproxy</a>
- access previous versions of DKIMproxy, submit bug reports, download patches
</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=207482">DKIMproxy Project Forums</a>
- a web-based discussion forum for DKIMproxy and Mail::DKIM
(forum provided by SourceForge)</li>
<li><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dkimproxy-users">DKIMproxy-Users Mailing List</a>
- an email-based discussion system with web-based archives.</li>
<li><a href="http://dkim.meulie.net/">meulie.net Forums</a>
- Evert Meulie had created a section on his site for DKIMproxy;
it's been around longer than the Sourceforge forums, so it may have
more answers
(forums provided by Evert Meulie)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/Mail-DKIM">CPAN Forums</a>
- this discussion forum is for the Mail::DKIM module. If you want to
discuss usage of the Mail::DKIM module in your own programs
you can ask here
(forum provided by CPAN)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please also post comments, suggestions, and patches, if you have any.
I will respond as I am able.
</p>
<p>
You can also email me directly
(<a href="mailto:jlong@messiah.edu">jlong@messiah.edu</a>),
but be warned I sometimes take a while to respond to email.
If it's about something others would know or be interested in,
please use the SourceForge-provided forum or mailing list.
