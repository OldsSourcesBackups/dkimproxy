<h2>How do I configure Postfix to sign ALL authorized outgoing mail?</h2>
<p>
Currently, the instructions you'll find describe how to configure Postfix
to sign all mail submitted to the <tt>submission</tt> port (port 587)
and has a valid From: address in the message headers. This works, because
the <tt>smtpd</tt> instance listening on port 587 can block unauthorized
mail.
</p>
<p>
So the first related question is:
<b>how to sign email accepted on port 25?</b>
</p>
<p>
The real question is, how to sign <em>only authorized email</em> accepted
on port 25... The trick is you must configure Postfix to only apply the
DK-signing content filter to authorized emails. This is complicated, since
there are many ways an authorized sender could be determined.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example- it will work ONLY IF you have an alternate content filter
to send unauthorized emails to, AND it will work ONLY IF your alternate
content filter reinjects messages using SMTP (<em>not sendmail</em>).
It assumes authorized users are
determined by <tt>permit_mynetworks</tt> and
<tt>permit_sasl_authenticated</tt>.
</p>
main.cf:
<pre class="programlisting">
  # set the default content filter to be the DomainKeys-signing filter
  content_filter = dksign

  # for any incoming email not authorized to relay, override the content
  # filter with the SPAM filter
  smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
      permit_mynetworks
      permit_sasl_authenticated
      check_recipient_access regexp:/etc/postfix/always_use_spamfilter
      reject_unauth_destination
</pre>

always_use_spamfilter:
<pre class="programlisting">
  # anytime this file is checked, the result should be "FILTER spamfilter..."
  # this entry should match a content filter defined in master.cf
  /./               FILTER spamfilter:localhost:10025
</pre>

<p>A second related question is:
<b>how to sign email submitted locally using <tt>sendmail</tt>?</b>
</p>
<p>
Try adding the <tt>content_filter</tt> option to the <tt>pickup</tt>
interface in <tt>master.cf</tt>.
</p>

master.cf:
<pre class="programlisting">
pickup    fifo  n       -       n       60      1       pickup
    -o content_filter=dksign
</pre>

<p>Finally:
<b>how to sign Postfix-generated email (e.g. delivery status notifications)?</b>
</p>
<p>
Good question. I think this is impossible, since as far as I know,
you cannot subject Postfix-generated mail to a content filter
(without using a second Postfix instance).
</p>

<h2><a name="notsigned">
Why are my messages not getting signed?</a></h2>
<p>
The most common reason for messages not getting signed is that your
outbound mail is not going through DKIMproxy. If you use the setup
recommended on this site, you will need to configure your mail
client (e.g. Thunderbird, etc.) to use port 587 to submit mail.
This is a change from the usual default of port 25.
</p>
<p>
See the next question if your mail client uses the <tt>sendmail</tt>
command-line interface (rather than SMTP) to submit mail.
</p>
<p>
If your mail <em>is</em> going through DKIMproxy, then check your
mail log file for an explanation. DKIMproxy will write to the log
file for every message it relays.
</p>

<h2><a name="sendmail">
How do I sign email submitted locally using <tt>sendmail</tt>?</a></h2>
<p>
Email submitted using Postfix <tt>sendmail</tt> on the same server as
dkimproxy will not get signed unless you add the 
<tt>content_filter</tt> option to the <tt>pickup</tt>
interface in <tt>master.cf</tt>.
</p>

<div>
master.cf:
<pre class="programlisting">
pickup    fifo  n       -       n       60      1       pickup
    -o content_filter=dksign:[127.0.0.1]:10027
</pre>
</div>


<h2><a name="verifiednotsigned">
Outgoing mail is getting an Authentication-Results header instead
of the expected DomainKey-Signature. Verifiers report "no signature".
What's going on?</a></h2>
<p>
Your outgoing mail is going through the
DKIMproxy <em>verifier</em> (dkimproxy.in) instead of the
DKIMproxy <em>signer</em> (dkimproxy.out). Messages are verified or signed
depending on which Postfix port you submit the mail on. If you followed
my instructions, Postfix port 25 mail gets <em>verified</em> (this is the
port other MTAs use to send mail to you) and Postfix port 587 mail gets
<em>signed</em>. Most email clients (e.g. Thunderbird) default to port 25,
so you should change that to port 587. (Port 587 is the standard mail
submission port according to
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">RFC 2476</a>.)
</p>

<h2><a name="onlysign">
My server is only used for sending email.  Can I make it sign
messages on port 25 instead of port 587 as used in the example?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes. In your master.cf, look at the example for using the submission port,
and add those same parameters to the smtp service. This will configure
Postfix to reject incoming mail, so only use this fix if you really only
send mail with your server. E.g. you might have...
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
smtp  inet  n     -       n       -       -       smtpd
    -o smtpd_etrn_restrictions=reject
    -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
    -o content_filter=dksign:[127.0.0.1]:10027
    -o receive_override_options=no_address_mappings
    -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject
submission  inet  n     -       n       -       -       smtpd
    -o smtpd_etrn_restrictions=reject
    -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
    -o content_filter=dksign:[127.0.0.1]:10027
    -o receive_override_options=no_address_mappings
    -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject
</pre>

<h2><a name="tlserror">
Outgoing messages get stuck in the queue before getting signed.
The Postfix log files report TLS handshake error. What causes this?</a></h2>
<p>
Postfix is trying to use TLS (encryption) when sending email through
the content filter. This won't work. You'll need to configure your
post-dksign-smtpd server to not announce TLS support, or configure your
pre-dksign-smtp client to not use TLS.
</p>
<p>
This example shows how to configure the post-dksign-smtpd server to not
announce TLS support.
</p>

<div>
master.cf:
<pre class="programlisting">
#
# service for accepting messages FROM the DomainKeys signing filter
#
127.0.0.1:10028 inet  n  -      n       -       10      smtpd
    <b>-o smtpd_use_tls=no</b>
    -o content_filter=
    -o receive_override_options=no_unknown_recipient_checks,no_header_body_checks
    -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
    -o smtpd_client_restrictions=
    -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
    -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
    -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
    -o smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts=127.0.0.0/8
</pre>
</div>

<h2><a name="connectfailure">
I get "socket connect failure: Connection
refused" or "socket connect failure: Invalid argument". What causes this?
</a></h2>
<p>
You are running dkimproxy.in and/or dkimproxy.out, and you connect to the
listening port, but the connection is terminated immediately. Furthermore,
you get the following output from dkimproxy:
</p>
<pre>
./dkimproxy.in: socket connect failure: Connection refused
</pre>
<p>
(On some platforms, the error is <tt>socket connect failure:
Invalid argument</tt>.)
</p>
<p>
The filter is unable to connect to its "destination" port. Normally, Postfix
should be listening on this port. Make sure you have added the appropriate
entries to master.cf for the listening port and have restarted Postfix.
