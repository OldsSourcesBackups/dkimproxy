DKIMproxy has evolved from my earlier project,
<a href="http://jason.long.name/dkfilter/">Dkfilter</a>,
which was based on <a href="http://bent.latency.net/smtpprox/">smtpprox</a>
and <a href="http://killa.net/infosec/Mail-DomainKeys/">Mail::DomainKeys</a>.
My thanks go out to Bennett Todd for providing smtpprox and
Anthony D. Urso for providing Mail::DomainKeys.

<h2>Installing DKIMproxy</h2>

<p>
The following steps are recommended for installing dkimproxy:
<ol>
<li>Determine where you want to install dkimproxy's program files,
e.g. <tt>/usr/local/dkimproxy</tt>.</li>
<li>"cd" to the directory containing dkimproxy's source code and type
<b>./configure --prefix=</b> followed by the location in which you want
to install the filter. E.g.
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dkimproxy
</pre>
</li>
<li>Run <b>make install</b> to install the program files to the desired
directory. If you used /usr/local/dkimproxy as the prefix, the filter
scripts will be installed in /usr/local/dkimproxy/bin and the Perl module
files will be in /usr/local/dkimproxy/lib.</li>
<li>Create a Unix user/group dedicated to running dkimproxy. E.g.
<tt>dkim</tt>.</li>
<li>Create a startup/shutdown script for the filter. A sample script
(<tt>sample-dkim-init-script.sh</tt>) is provided...
make sure to check, and modify if necessary, the user,
group, and directory found in the script. Also, you may need to adjust
command-line arguments for starting the filter(s).  Then you can copy it
to /etc/init.d/dkimproxy and use it like any other init script.</li>
</ol>
</p>
