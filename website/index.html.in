This is the main web site for the software projects Mail-DKIM and
DKIMproxy.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mail-DKIM</b> is a Perl module that implements the new
<a href="http://mipassoc.org/dkim/">Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)</a>
standard, and the older
<a href="http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys">Yahoo! DomainKeys</a>
standard, both of which sign and verify emails using digital signatures
and DNS records. Mail-DKIM can be used by any
Perl program that wants to provide support for DKIM and/or DomainKeys.
</p>
<p>
<b>DKIMproxy</b> is an SMTP-proxy that signs and/or verifies emails,
using the Mail::DKIM module.  It is designed for Postfix, but should
work with any mail server.
It comprises two separate proxies,
an "outbound" proxy for signing outgoing email,
and an "inbound" proxy for verifying signatures of incoming email.
With Postfix, the proxies can operate as either
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_PROXY_README.html">Before-Queue</a>
or
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html">After-Queue</a>
content filters.

<p class="newsheader">2010-09-28 - DKIMproxy featured in GNU/Linux Magazine (French)</p>
<p>
Julien Vehent has written an article about DKIMproxy in the french issue
of Gnu/Linux Magazine. The article is now available under the
Creative Commons license, and thus he has published it on his wiki.
</p>
<p>
The article has been translated to English. It features a very nice
introduction and explanation to DKIM technology, and how DKIMproxy works.
Check it out!

<p class="newsheader">2009-07-30 - DKIMproxy 1.2; Subversion access</p>
<p>
First of all, DKIMproxy 1.2 is available.
(Actually, I posted it a few weeks ago, but neglected to write a
news post for it.) Version 1.2 is just a minor update on 1.1,
see the <a href="NEWS.txt">NEWS</a> file or
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=696471">RELEASE_NOTES</a>
for more information. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, I am now providing Subversion access to my code
repositories of Mail::DKIM and DKIMproxy
(as well as the older dkfilter project).
I have always tried to "release often", making this access unnecessary,
but nonetheless I thought it might be helpful to do this.
So if that strikes anyone's fancy, you can check it out on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkimproxy">DKIMproxy SourceForge project page</a>.

<p class="newsheader">2008-11-03 - DKIMproxy 1.1 has been released</p>
<p>
Version 1.1 of DKIMproxy is now available. Version 1.1 is a minor
upgrade over the previous version, 1.0.1, which fixes a number of bugs,
including: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Authentication-Results header, added by the verifier, has been fixed so that results for DomainKey signatures can be distinguished from results for DKIM signatures.</li>
<li>Both the signer and verifier, when errors occur (such as the next host being unavailable, or the syslog service is down), will now give an error message to the client via SMTP before disconnecting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more details on the new version, be sure to look at the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=207482&release_id=635360">RELEASE_NOTES</a>,
which are visible by clicking on the "Notes" icon on
the Download page.

<p class="newsheader">2008-02-14 - DKIMproxy 1.0.1 has been released</p>
<p>
Version 1.0 of DKIMproxy is now available. Version 1.0 is a major
upgrade over the previous version, 0.16. The new version supports
several new features, including: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>DKIMproxy can now be configured using configuration files,
instead of only through command-line argument. New installations will
want to take advantage of this. Editing a configuration file is much
nicer than having to edit the startup script.</li>
<li>DKIMproxy can now add multiple signatures in one pass. This lets
you, for example, generate a DomainKey-Signature *and* a DKIM-Signature
on your outgoing messages.</li>
<li>DKIMproxy now lets you specify different options depending on the
sender of the message being signed. This is helpful for sites hosting
many domains, who may want to use a different private key and/or
selector for each domain being hosted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more details on the new version, be sure to look at the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=207482&release_id=574908">RELEASE_NOTES</a>,
which are visible by clicking on the "Notes" icon on
the Download page.
