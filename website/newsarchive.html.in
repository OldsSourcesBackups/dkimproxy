<p>
On this page I have archived all my old dkim-related news postings.
</p>
<p>Back to main <a href=".">DKIMproxy page</a>.</p>


<p class="newsheader">2007-11-06 - DKIMproxy participates in
Interoperability Event, and more</p>
<p>
DKIMproxy recently participated, along with 20 other organizations, in a
DKIM Interoperability Testing Event at Alt-N Technologies in Dallas, TX.
Although my participation was over the Internet, rather than in person,
I still achieved quite a bit. The latest development release of the
Mail::DKIM perl module (on CPAN) contains several fixes for problems
discovered at the Interoperability event. These fixes will eventually
improve not only DKIMproxy but also SpamAssassin which uses the same
underlying module. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, I've posted a test release of the next version of
DKIMproxy! This test release introduces a number of long-awaited
features, including 
<ul>
<li>the ability to add multiple signatures (i.e. a DomainKey signature
AND a DKIM signature)</li>
<li>the ability to use different keys (or other signature parameters)
per domain</li>
</ul>
<p>
To use this test release, you will need the latest development release
of Mail::DKIM. An easy way to get both is go to
<a href="http://dkimproxy.sourceforge.net"/>http://dkimproxy.sourceforge.net/</a>,
and look for the "Download" section. There are links there that will
take you directly to the latest versions. 
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-10-11 - DKIM-Proxy now on SourceForge</p>
<p>
Interest in DKIM-Proxy and Mail::DKIM has been heavier recently, so
I finally decided to "bite the bullet" and move the project
from my personal home page to SourceForge. Therefore, DKIM-Proxy
now has a mailing list, as well as new forums and an issue tracker.
If you want to get involved with DKIM-Proxy or Mail::DKIM, please
subscribe to the mailing list and/or "monitor" the forums.
</p>
<p>
The project page for DKIM-Proxy is

<p class="newsheader">2007-07-31 - Mail::DKIM 0.28 available here for testing</p>
<p>
Version 0.28 contains a fix for a line-wrapping bug reported
on <a href="http://dkim.meulie.net/">dkim.meulie.net</a>.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-07-25 - Mail::DKIM 0.27 available here for testing</p>
<p>
In this release I've been working on better support for sender signing
policies. I'll be posting it to CPAN in a week or two if no problems
are noticed.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-05-24 - dkimproxy 0.16 has been released</p>
<p>
This version of dkimproxy is supposed to let you control how many
processes are running, with the --min_servers and --max_servers command-line
options.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you have 0.25 or better of Mail::DKIM, the signatures will be
made "pretty", i.e. line-wrapped to less than 80 characters per line.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-05-24 - Mail::DKIM 0.26 now available</p>
<p>
The DKIM spec has now been published as
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4871.txt">RFC 4871</a>.
This RFC contains a change in what version number signatures should use.
Please update your Mail::DKIM module to 0.26 so that these new "v=1"
signatures are recognized and generated.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-05-10 - Mail::DKIM 0.25 available here for testing</p>
<p>
This release limits which headers are signed in an outgoing message.
This will create more reliable signatures.
</p>
<p>
I'll post it on CPAN later this week.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-05-01 - Forum now available</p>
<p>
There is now a DKIM-Proxy forum at
<a href="http://dkim.meulie.net/">dkim.meulie.net</a>.
Thank you Evert Meulie for offering to set this up.
You can use this forum for questions about DKIM-proxy or the
Mail::DKIM perl module. Also feel free to post general comments,
suggestions, and patches. I'll try to keep an eye on the forum.
</p>
<p>
Thanks also to those who responded with an offer of a mailing list.
I might still take one of you up on the offer, e.g. for an "Announcements"
mailing list. But for now, I'll wait and see if the forum meets
our needs.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-04-16 - Need for a mailing list</p>
<p>
For some time now I've recognized that I should setup a mailing list
(or forum) for this project. I'm not very quick at responding to questions
that come via email, and the only way I can announce new releases or new
problems with dkimproxy is via this website.
But I can't make up my mind whether to start a Sourceforge project, get a
Yahoo!-groups mailing list, or something else? Feel free to send me
your thoughts.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-03-16 - Reorganized Dkimproxy setup documentation</p>
<p>
Today I rearranged the setup documentation seen on this page. I've moved
the Postfix-specific instructions to separate pages so that overall
things are less Postfix-centric. I also put in a plug for using
SpamAssassin for DKIM verification.
</p>
<p>
Let me know what you think. Are things easier to follow? For comparison,
I've saved the <a href="old-docs-06.html">old docs</a>.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-03-13 - Mail::DKIM 0.24 available here for testing</p>
<p>
A bugfix release. I'll post it on CPAN later this week.
Update 2007-03-15: I've now posted it on CPAN.</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-03-02 - dkimproxy 0.15 has been released</p>
<p>
Now that the Mail::DKIM module supports DomainKeys signatures as well as
DKIM signatures, dkimproxy needed a way to select which type of signature
to use. Version 0.15 has this capability... use the - signature argument
to the dkimproxy.out script.
</p>
<p>
Note: I'm still looking for a way to extend dkimproxy for doing multiple
signatures. I figure I'll need to have dkimproxy read a configuration file
to determine which signatures to apply and how to generate them.
So now the main holdup is deciding the format of this configuration file.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-02-28 - Mail::DKIM 0.23 now on CPAN</p>
<p>
I've uploaded version 0.23 to CPAN.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-02-22 - Mail::DKIM 0.23 available here for testing</p>
<p>
This version contains a few fixes for DomainKeys support and improves
some diagnostic messages. Also, DKIM signatures have been brought up-to-date
with the latest spec. The signer module will now generate newer-style DKIM
signatures (with v=0.5 tag).
</p>
<p>
I'm still working on an update to dkimproxy that will allow generation
of DomainKey signatures, or multiple signatures, which can be done by
Mail::DKIM. The main reason for delay is that I can't decide on an
appropriate configuration file format.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-02-09 - Mail::DKIM 0.22 is now on CPAN</p>
<p>
I've posted version 0.22 of the Mail::DKIM module on CPAN.
I'm still a little nervous about the addition of DomainKeys support...
I suspect it may have a few surpises still in store.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2007-01-19 - Mail::DKIM 0.22 available here for testing</p>
<p>
This version is another bugfix release, just fixing a few bugs.
Again, if you're upgrading from 0.19 or below, this version introduces
support for Yahoo! DomainKeys. Programmers using this module should take
note that any recognized signature will make the message verify,
so when Mail::DKIM says the message verified, you could have either a
DKIM-Signature <em>or</em> a DomainKey-Signature (or both).
</p>
<p>
Dkimproxy has not been updated yet to sign with Yahoo! DomainKeys
signatures, or to sign with multiple signatures.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-11-29 - Mail::DKIM 0.21 available here for testing</p>
<p>
This version fixes a few bugs found in version 0.20. Nothing else.
But if you're upgrading from a version older than 0.20, see the notes
below about changes in 0.20.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-10-24 - Mail::DKIM 0.20 available here for testing</p>
<p>
This new version has support for
<a href="http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys">DomainKeys</a> signatures
(yes, that's right),
and for signing/verifying multiple signatures in one pass.
See the What's New link <a href="#download">below</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you install this version, your DKIM-aware application could
report a valid signature even if there's no DKIM-Signature! That's because
the verifier recognizes DomainKey-Signatures as valid too.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-09-21 - dkimproxy 0.14 now available</p>
<p>
A frequently requested feature was a sample initialization script that
didn't require the startproc and killproc commands. Version 0.14 of
dkimproxy includes this.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-09-13 - Mail-DKIM 0.19 now available on CPAN</p>
<p>
Heh, after three months I finally get around to posting 0.19 on CPAN.
Sorry for the delay.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-06-15 - Mail-DKIM 0.19 available here for testing</p>
<p>
I was asked about running Mail-DKIM on Perl 5.6. After some investigation,
I found it is possible, with two minor changes to the code. These
changes are now available in version 0.19 of Mail-DKIM.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-06-14 - Mail-DKIM 0.18 now available on CPAN</p>
<p>
I'm satisfied 0.18 does not introduce new bugs, so I'm posting it on
CPAN.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-06-08 - Mail-DKIM 0.18 available here for testing</p>
<p>
I finally figured out how to do signing/verifying without using the
heavy-weight Crypt::RSA module, instead relying on Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA.
This new release removes the dependency on the Crypt::RSA Perl module.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-06-06 - Mail-DKIM 0.17 now available on CPAN</p>
<p>
I've been running 0.17 on my own server for several days now and have not
seen any show-stoppers, so I've posted version 0.17 on CPAN.
</p>

<p class="newsheader">2006-05-26 - <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org">SpamAssassin</a>
version 3.1.2 released</p>
<p>
SpamAssassin 3.1.2 was released yesterday. One of its new features is support
for my Mail::DKIM module. I'm flattered that the SpamAssassin folks
would choose to provide support for my little-known module :).
</p>
<p>
This has given me some motivation to spend some time improving Mail::DKIM.
On this page you can now find version 0.17 (not yet released to CPAN)
which has been updated to support the latest DKIM drafts.
</p>
